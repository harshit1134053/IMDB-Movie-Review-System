# IMDB-Movie-Review-System
Movie Review system is used to check the feedback of movie based on users comments. In this model I used RNN to create the architecture and trained the model using imdb dataset present in the tensorflow . This model has accuracy more than 80% and is able to Predict sentiment of any movie based on user feedback.
